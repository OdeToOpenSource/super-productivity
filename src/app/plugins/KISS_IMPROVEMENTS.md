# Additional KISS Improvements for Plugin System

## Already Completed âœ…

1. Simplified Node.js execution to single IPC event (PLUGIN_EXEC_NODE_SCRIPT)
2. Removed complex dual consent dialogs
3. Simplified plugin runner - removed sandboxing
4. Simplified security service - informational only
5. Simplified manifest validation - only essential fields
6. Simplified plugin hooks - no timeouts
7. Simplified cache service - no compression or cleanup
8. Simplified cleanup service - only track iframes
9. Increased all size limits generously

## Further Improvements We Could Make ðŸš€

### 1. Remove Unused Files

- Remove `plugin-compression.util.ts` and `.spec.ts` (no longer used)
- Remove old component `plugin-node-consent-dialog.component.ts`
- Remove all `.old.ts` files after confirming everything works

### 2. Simplify Plugin Loading

- Remove the concept of "preloading" entirely from code
- Load all plugins synchronously on startup (simpler than lazy loading)
- Remove the loading state tracking - just try to load and handle errors

### 3. Simplify Type System

- Consider removing the mapper layer if internal types are stable
- Use the same types internally and externally where possible

### 4. Simplify Persistence

- Consider combining meta and user data into single store
- Remove the "safe" methods that avoid writes during startup

### 5. Simplify Error Handling

- Replace all complex error handling with simple console.error
- Let errors bubble up naturally instead of wrapping everything

### 6. Simplify Plugin API

- Remove rarely used features
- Combine similar methods (e.g., various ways to show UI)

### 7. Simplify Testing

- Remove complex test scenarios
- Focus on simple happy-path tests only

## Philosophy

The goal is to make the plugin system so simple that:

- Any developer can understand it in 15 minutes
- Bugs have nowhere to hide
- Performance is great because there's less code
- Users have full control and transparency
