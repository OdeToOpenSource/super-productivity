                Isn't procrastination interesting? It doesn't seem to make any sense to do
                it, since it is not in your long term interest at all. But still everybody
                does. It helps a lot explore und gain a better understanding on how it
                works for you personally! Some basic questions to ask yourself could be:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>What feelings are eliciting your temptation to procrastinate?</li>
                <li>Where do you feel them in your body?</li>
                <li>What do they remind you of?</li>
                <li>
                  What happens to the thought of procrastinating as you observe it? Does
                  it intensify? Dissipate? Cause other emotions to arise?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How are the sensations in your body shifting as you continue to rest
                  your awareness on them?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Writing down your procrastination triggers</h3>
              <p>
                Another very effective method is to record, what triggered your urge to
                procrastinate. For example I personally often have the urge to quickly
                jump to reddit or my favorite news site whenever my browser window comes
                into focus. Since I started writing down my triggers in a simple empty
                text document, I became aware of how ingrained this pattern was and it
                helped me to experiment with different counter measures.
              </p>

              <p>
                People with high procrastination levels usually have low self-compassion.
                So practice it! It improves your feeling of self-worth, fosters positive
                emotions and can help you overcome procrastination, of course. Try a
                little exercise:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sit down for bit and stretch yourself, if you like, calm down a little
                  bit
                </li>
                <li>Try to listen to the thoughts and feelings that arise</li>
                <li>
                  Are you responding to yourself in a way that you would respond to a
                  friend?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the answer is no, imagine your friend in your situation. What you
                  would say to them? What you would do for them?
                </li>
              </ul>
