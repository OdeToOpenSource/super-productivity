# Minimal Plugin Example

The simplest possible Super Productivity plugin - just 10 lines of code!

## What it does

Shows a notification when you complete a task.

## Files

- `manifest.json` - Plugin metadata (required)
- `plugin.js` - Plugin code (required)

## Installation

1. Zip these two files together
2. Upload in Super Productivity → Settings → Plugins

That's it! No build process needed.

## Making Changes

Just edit `plugin.js` directly - it's plain JavaScript.
